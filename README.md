# ElasticSearch-CRUD
Implemented CRUD operations with ElasticSearch
Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to develop a complete application that performs CRUD
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on an Elasticsearch database using Python. You will
implement wrapper functions for each CRUD operation and integrate these functions with the
FastAPI framework to expose these operations as RESTful APIs.
Requirements:
1. Set Up Elasticsearch Database:
○ Install and configure Elasticsearch.
○ Create an index for the assignment.
2. Implement CRUD Wrapper Functions:
○ Create a Python module to connect to the Elasticsearch database.
○ Implement wrapper functions for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
3. Develop RESTful APIs with FastAPI:
○ Install FastAPI and Uvicorn.
○ Create a FastAPI application that exposes the CRUD operations as RESTful
APIs.
○ Integrate the CRUD wrapper functions with the FastAPI endpoints.
4. Test the Application:
○ Test the CRUD operations through the FastAPI endpoints using a tool like
Postman or curl.
